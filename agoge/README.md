# Agoge

**Agoge** is a pedagogical 3D **compressible Euler** solver written in C++. It was developed as a teaching and research tool for advanced computational physics and engineering courses (e.g., CMSE 822) to demonstrate:

- High-performance computing (HPC) concepts
- Numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs
- Modern software engineering practices using C++ and CMake
- Techniques for modular code design and extensibility
- Integration of self-gravity via an FFT-based Poisson solver
- Potential for GPU offloading and other advanced parallelization strategies

The name “agoge”—inspired by the rigorous training system of ancient Sparta—reflects its role as a challenging training ground for mastering computational methods and software development in scientific computing.

## Key Features

1. **3D Compressible Euler Equations**
   - Second-order finite-difference (with minmod limiters) or higher-order schemes available.
   - Two-stage Runge-Kutta time stepping.
   - Supports periodic and simple boundary conditions.

2. **Self-Gravity (Optional)**
   - FFT-based Poisson solver to solve \(\nabla^2 \phi = 4\pi G\,\rho\)
   - Adds gravitational source terms (body force in momentum and work in energy equations) using spatially varying potential (\(\phi\)).

3. **Modular Code Structure**
   - Clear separation of data structures (`Field3D`), solver routines (`EulerSolver`), gravity routines (`GravitySolver`), and I/O (`HDF5_IO`).
   - Build system based on CMake for cross-platform compilation and easy extensibility.

4. **HDF5 I/O**
   - Write final solution fields (density, momentum components, energy, gravitational potential, etc.) to HDF5 files.
   - Output is compatible with popular visualization tools (e.g., yt, ParaView).

5. **Extensibility**
   - Designed to be a test bed for adding additional physics (e.g., viscosity, magnetic fields, multi-species flows) and numerical methods (e.g., higher-order or WENO schemes).   
   - Performance monitoring via a custom `PerformanceMonitor` module.

## Building Agoge on HPCC at MSU

Agoge is designed to run on high-performance computing clusters. At MSU’s HPCC, follow these steps:

1. **Access HPCC:**
   - Log in to HPCC using your preferred method (SSH, terminal, etc.).
   - Load the necessary modules (e.g., GCC, HDF5). For example:
     ```bash
     module purge
     module load HDF5
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agoge.git
   cd agoge
   ```

3. **Configure and Build:**
   From the top-level `agoge` directory, you may simply run `make` to build the code:
   
4. **Generate the Executable:**
   - The build process should produce an executable (e.g., `agoge_run`).

---

## Running Agoge on HPCC

Once built, you can run Agoge on HPCC either interactively or as a batch job.

### **Interactive Run:**

```bash
./agoge_run problems/SodShockTube.yaml
```

### **Batch Job Submission Example (SLURM):**

Create a job script (e.g., `job.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=agoge_run
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16
#SBATCH --time=00:30:00
#SBATCH --partition=standard

# Load necessary modules
module purge
module load HDF5

# Navigate to the agoge directory
cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR

# Run the executable with the desired problem configuration
./agoge_run ../problems/SodShockTube.yaml
```

Submit the job:

```bash
sbatch job.sh
```

## Running Self-Gravity & Advanced Features

- **Self-Gravity:**
  - Enable self-gravity simply by specifying a problem that uses the GravitySolver.
  - The solver uses an FFT-based Poisson solver (see `GravitySolver.cpp`) to compute the gravitational potential.  

- **GPU Offloading (Future Work):**
  - The code is structured to allow extensions such as GPU offloading via CUDA or OpenMP target directives.
  - This will require additional configuration and might involve separate compilation flags and modules on HPCC.

---

## Output & Visualization

- **Output Files:**
  - Agoge writes simulation data to HDF5 files (e.g., `agoge_final.h5`).
- **Visualization Tools:**
  - Use Python (with yt or matplotlib), ParaView, or similar HDF5-compatible tools.
  - See the example Jupyter notebook in the `viz` directory.
