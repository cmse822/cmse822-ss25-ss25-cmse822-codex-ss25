    "I would fix this by recording the time right before the loop initiates and as soon as it exits the loop. The end time would be subtracted by the start time to find the elapsed time; I would do this by using std::chrono and without doing any setup or teardown operations to ensure the accuracy of the time result. I would then divide the cachesize by this amount of time to determine the bandwidth of the cache. In this instance the bandwidth would be in words/s per the provided code. "
