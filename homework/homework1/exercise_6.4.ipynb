    "if your loop describes the (ùëñ, ùëó) indices of a two-dimensional\n",
    "array, it is often best to let the ùëñ-index be in the inner loop for Fortran, and the ùëó-index inner for C. Can you come up with at least two reasons why this is possibly better for performance?"

    "The difference between C and Fortran that this represents is their difference in memory ordering. In Fortran, 2D arrays are column-ordered, where each column in a 2D array is laid out sequentially in memory. In C, these arrays are row-ordered, with each row being laid out sequentially in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this distinction, we want to match the ordering with our innermost index, so that we can read adjacent memory \"slots\" in a stride-1 setup. In doing this, we read fewer overall cachelines for the intended operation, as we only need to load any given cacheline once, rather than jump around to non-adjacent memory. Another benefit of this approach is that, by reading adjacent memory in this way, we expose pipelining & SIMD operations within the CPU."
