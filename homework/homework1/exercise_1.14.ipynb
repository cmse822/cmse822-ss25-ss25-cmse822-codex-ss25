    "The option between this ordering is dependant on a few factors. For example, say we are given the following:\n",

Therefore, $A$'s $i$ th row would likely remain in cache. Since $A$'s rows are shorter than its columns, it makes most sense to repeatedly grab those values and store them in cache. \n",

    "**Given the algorithm, if we were to loop in the order of $j,i,k$**: We would be repeatedly accessing a different row of $A$ s for each inner loop. The data for each row would be used and then immediately wiped from cache even though it will be reused with the following outer loops. This is particularly troubling because $A$ has significantly more rows than columns, meaning reusable data would be removed/added to cache more times than the previous loop ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario just shows one example where the number of columns of $A$ is greater than the rows. Depending on the number of columns of $A$ and rows of $B$ in comparison to the shared dimension, there are more efficient orderings for looping. Each option must be analyzed - keeping in mind the best practices of keeping recently accessed and repeatedly used data in cache, something that is not trivial. "
