# Homework Assignment 1

## Reading

- **Chapters 1, 6, and 15 of [High-Performance Scientific Computing](https://cmse822.github.io/assets/EijkhoutIntroToHPC2020.pdf)**:

  - Focus on understanding the key principles outlined in each chapter. Take notes on:
    - Chapter 1: Basics of single-processor computing, including von Neumann architecture and memory hierarchies.
    - Chapter 6: Techniques for programming for performance, including peak performance, bandwidth, and optimization strategies.
    - Chapter 15: Complexity analysis and its importance in scientific computing.
  - Prepare to discuss how these concepts relate to high-performance computing in class.

- **The Syllabus and Course Structure**:

  - Review the syllabus and course structure on the course website.
  - Navigate to the course GitHub Discussions board:
    - Post a question about the syllabus or upvote an existing question.
    - This will ensure everyone has clarity about course expectations and structure.
