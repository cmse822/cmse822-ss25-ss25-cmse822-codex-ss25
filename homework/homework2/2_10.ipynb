    "Normally multiplyong matricies is a O(n^2) computation becasue each n represents the size of a matrix which needs ot be iterated through. using parallel addition to sum n numbers we now know the speed is O(log2(n)) woth O(n/2) processors. we need to use each o the n^2 element in the matrix which we can do becaue because the summations are being asssumed to the total numer of processors required. because instead of the sumation taking place between n and n one of them is O(log2N) because as sceen in the cell under this"
