## Exercise 2.3

Assume that an addition takes a certain unit time, and that moving a number from one processor to another takes that same unit time. Show that the communication time equals the computation time. 

Now assume that sending a number from processor $p$ to $p \pm k$ takes time $k$. Show that the execution time of the parallel algorithm now is of the same order as the sequential time.
